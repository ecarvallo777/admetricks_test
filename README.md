## Admetricks Challenge.
***
Capture and extract data from Internet (:

# The implemented solution
***
The robot decided that this challenge will be developed with **Node.js** using a **headless browser** to navigate into the 
content of the instructions url's and then, get elements with the data requested (using CSS selectors).

Finally, export data and take screenshots.

In addition, the robot __se encontrÃ³__ with some difficulties to save messy data. In the first challenge (songs.js), he gets 
elements with the data requested (Autor and song) in this example order:

    Autor: 'Jeff Beck, Johnny Depp'
    Song: 'This is a song for Miss Hedy LamarrJeffBeck, Johnny Depp'

And he designed a function to separate autor details of song str (**or may be song property**).

    let separateData = (allText, autor) => {
                        let song = allText.split(/(?=[A-Z])/); 
                        autor = autor.split(/(?=[A-Z])/);
                        song = song.slice(0, -(autor.length)); 
                        return song.toString().replaceAll(',',"");
    }


# How to run?
***
First of all, you need **to verify that you have nodeJs +8 installed.**

    node -v

If you don't have nodejs installed, you need to navigate to https://nodejs.org and follows the steps of installation.

Then, when you have installed nodeJs, you need **to check that you have installed npm.**

    npm -v

Now, **you need to install some libraries.**

**puppeteer:** A high-level API to control chrome over the devTools protocols. https://pptr.dev/.

    npm i puppeteer 
    
**objects-to-csv:** A library that allows convert arrays of objects into csv files. https://www.npmjs.com/package/objects-to-csv.

    npm i objects-to-csv 

***

At that time, you have all of things that you need **to start the project.**

**To run the first challenge,** please stay in the **root folder** and type this command:

    node songs.js 

**To run the second challenge,** please stay in the **root folder** and type this command:
